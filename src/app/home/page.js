      <h1>What we do?</h1>
      <h2>Bringing our Community together</h2>
      <p>
        Neighbours around the world turn to FAAA daily to receive trusted
        information, give and get help, get things done, and build real-world
        connections with those nearby — neighbours, businesses, and public
        services.
      </p>
      <p>
        Building connections in the real world is a universal human need. That
        truth, and the reality that neighbourhoods are among the most important
        communities in our lives, have been guiding principles for FAAA since
        the beginning.
      </p>
      <p>
        A wide variety of public services (e.g. police, fire, councils, NHS)
        partner with FAAA to provide members with critical, local information in
        real time. Members can directly engage with these public services, which
        we believe is a core part of building stronger neighbourhoods. No matter
        the situation — fires to power outages, road closures to community
        meetings — members can receive trusted, local information from an
        official source.{" "}
      </p>
      <h2>Connecting the neighbourhood</h2>
      <p>
        We recognise that thriving communities are made up of the neighbours and
        organisations that build stronger, more vibrant, and resilient
        neighbourhoods.
      </p>
      <ul>
