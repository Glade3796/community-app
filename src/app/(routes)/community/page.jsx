          We want everyone to feel welcome on FAAA, and we have created these
          Guidelines to define the values of the community we want to build. On
          FAAA, you’re connected not by a shared preference, but a shared
          connection to a place — your neighbourhood. Let’s build a strong one
          together.
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            <strong> Be respectful to your neighbours : </strong>
            You’re speaking to your real neighbours. Strong communities are
            built on strong relationships.
          </li>

          <li>
            <strong> Do not discriminate : </strong>
            We do not tolerate racism, hateful language, or discrimination of
            any kind.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong> Discuss important topics in the right way : </strong>
            We have policies and dedicated spaces for important non-local
            topics, such as national politics.
          </li>

          <li>
            <strong> Use your true identity : </strong>
            Nextdoor is built on trust — we want everyone to know they’re
            communicating with their real neighbour, and therefore require you
            to use your true identity.
          </li>

          <li>
            <strong> Do not engage in harmful activity : </strong>
            We prohibit any activity that could hurt someone, from physical harm
            to scams.
          </li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          Everyone on FAAA must adhere to our Community Guidelines. We also have
          Community Guidelines specifically for advertisers and local businesses
          to define the content, behaviour, and values we want to create on
          FAAA. The following defines our Community Guidelines for public
          services.
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            <strong>Be helpful to members : </strong>FAAA members primarily want
            to hear from public services about the progress you are making
            towards improving their neighbourhood. Share updates that help
            members stay informed, participate in local issues, be aware of
            safety risks, and prepare for emergencies to build stronger, more
            resilient neighbourhoods.
