      <h1>Community Guidelines</h1>
      <h2>We are glad that you are here.</h2>
      <p>
        We want everyone to feel welcome on FAAA, and we have created these
        Guidelines to define the values of the community we want to build. On
        FAAA, you’re connected not by a shared preference, but a shared
        connection to a place — your neighbourhood. Let’s build a strong one
        together.
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <strong> Be respectful to your neighbours : </strong>
          You’re speaking to your real neighbours. Strong communities are built
          on strong relationships.
        </li>

        <li>
          <strong> Do not discriminate : </strong>
          We do not tolerate racism, hateful language, or discrimination of any
          kind.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong> Discuss important topics in the right way : </strong>
          We have policies and dedicated spaces for important non-local topics,
          such as national politics.
        </li>

        <li>
          <strong> Use your true identity : </strong>
          Nextdoor is built on trust — we want everyone to know they’re
          communicating with their real neighbour, and therefore require you to
          use your true identity.
        </li>

        <li>
          <strong> Do not engage in harmful activity : </strong>
          We prohibit any activity that could hurt someone, from physical harm
          to scams.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        Everyone on FAAA must adhere to our Community Guidelines. We also have
        Community Guidelines specifically for advertisers and local businesses
        to define the content, behaviour, and values we want to create on FAAA.
        The following defines our Community Guidelines for public services.
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <strong>Be helpful to members : </strong>FAAA members primarily want
          to hear from public services about the progress you are making towards
          improving their neighbourhood. Share updates that help members stay
          informed, participate in local issues, be aware of safety risks, and
          prepare for emergencies to build stronger, more resilient
          neighbourhoods.
        </li>
